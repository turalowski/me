I was looking for novels about managerial positions in IT. After searching, I found two books, The Phoenix Project and The Unicorn Project. I want to talk about **The Phoenix Project** in my story.

**Storyline**
=============


After a call from the head of HR, **Bill,** an IT manager in **Parts Unlimited,** gets faced with a dismissal scare. After the conversation, he learns that it is promotion instead of dismissal, but he couldn't fill himself comfortably for this position anyway.

With the conversation with **Steve, the company CEO**, he accepts the offer without knowing the coming storm.

The main points are how things are going in Parts Unlimited, the issues they faced, and the **conversation between Bill and Eric,** the possible new board member of Parts Unlimited.

Although this book is related to IT, be sure that you will see your company in any part of this book. There are some interesting aspects from this book that I want to focus on in my story — It's about possible lacks that can push our project or company to the cliff.

**Categories of work in Parts Unlimited**
=========================================

> “Yes, I think I can,” I say. “At the plant, I gave you one category, which was **business projects**, like Phoenix,” I say. “Later, I realized that I didn’t mention **internal IT projects**. A week after that, I realized that **changes are another category of work**. But it was only after the Phoenix fiasco that I saw the last one, because of how it prevented all other work from getting completed, and that’s the last category, isn’t it? **Firefighting. Unplanned work**.”

When we read conversations between **Eric and Bill,** we see that they categorize the work of the business into **four types**.

1.  The first one is **business projects**. All companies have business projects like The Phoenix  that their future depends on them. The company needs to follow  deadlines, manage its budget for the project, and keep all systems in a working state while developing business projects. They always need a plan B for possible troubles that they can face.
2.  We can follow up work categories with **internal projects,** and it is about the **infrastructure of IT operations.** Moving from physical servers to virtual servers or making a ticket system  are interior projects of a company. Delaying this work can make things hard to follow up when any problems occur.
3.  **Updates and Changes is another type of work.** This category depends on the first two ones, and it is about maintenance and updates of internal and business projects. If we avoid this category of jobs, we can face losing all of our internal and external projects in the long term.  
    They will not be open to growth anymore, needing radical changes to handle them. When you have any problems with the current project, you cannot find the root of the problem.
4.  Last but the most important category is **unplanned work**. This type of work is the book's central idea that **caused the crash of all IT works.** Before planning the first three category works, people have investigated, but you can face unplanned work anytime. If you don't know how to handle things you're not planning, it can damage all your planned work. That's why Parts Unlimited failed, and their unplanned works didn't let you do your planned work correctly. When they decided to manage it, it was **too late.**

> “Your job as VP of IT Operations is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that delivers value to the business while **minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work**, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure IT service.”

Communication and trust problems between different departments
==============================================================

> “I told you yesterday that change management around here is hit-ormiss,” Patty says, sighing. “Some groups have their own local changemanagement process, like yours. But most groups do nothing at all. Yesterday’s outage is just proof that we need to have something at the enterprise level. Right now, the left hand rarely knows what the right hand is doing.”

In Parts Unlimited, it's easy to see communication leak between departments. There is not any communication problem **because there is not any communication.** _The left hand rarely knows what the right hand is doing in Parts Unlimited._

All departments are doing significant changes in internal and external projects without notifying anyone, and if these changes happen simultaneously, all systems are down. They don't have any version control and collaboration tools to know which changes caused these crashes.

Because they have a communication problem, they also don't trust each other. When any problem occurs, each department thinks the other caused the issue without checking the recent changes. Departments blame each other, but all of them are guilty behind the scenes.

> Guys, the new change process saved our bacon this morning. Today, we had two groups simultaneously making changes to the materials management database and application servers. Neither group knew about the other. Rajiv spotted the potential collision on the change wall. **We decided that my changes would go in first, and I’d call him when we were done.** We could have totally made a mess of things. Keep those change cards coming, guys! It saved our butts today!

The fate of the project should not be on one person's shoulders.
================================================================

> “The chaotic way we currently work, Brent is having to fix the punctured hulls almost every day. I’m pretty sure, though, that Brent is one of the main reasons the hull is punctured in the first place. It’s not malicious, of course, but it’s just a side effect of the way we work and fix outages here.”

One of the main characters of this book is **Brent**, a life-saver of the company, and he can resolve issues reported by people. But actually, Brent is the guy who makes the issues — it's not malicious, of course, but behind the scenes, the main reason for these problems is **unplanned works** from Brent. All departments run to Brent when they have a problem, and **Brent didn't say to anyone how he fixed it**. If someone faces the same issue in the future, he will go to Brent again instead of fixing himself because he didn't learn anything from the last time.

> “Look, it’s rocket scientists like him that often cause the problem in the first place. Every time we escalate to Brent, we perpetuate our reliance on him, and **make it that much less likely we can fix things without him!**”

It's is my first story that I'm writing in a foreign language. We can add more things, but I did my best to make it clear and small. Hopefully, you will enjoy it while reading. I want to thank everyone involved in this book, and I would be happy to hear your thoughts if you have already read this book.
